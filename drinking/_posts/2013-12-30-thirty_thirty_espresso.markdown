Trying to dial in a new bag of coffee from Thirty-Thirty in Peoria,
IL. This one is really interesting. I think I like it, but it's a bit
strong at first. A little sweet, too.

Having trouble getting the grind right though. Sometimes it gives me
1oz in 30 second, and sometimes it does 4oz in 20 seconds while
spraying coffee everywhere. I'll play with it again tomorrow.

I did make a cappucino for my mother with this coffee, and she seemed
to enjoy it more than the previous stuff I was pulling.
