Better today! After messing with the dose and grind a bit, 18g at 1.8
(relative) grind seems to work pretty well for this coffee. Earlier I
was getting a lot of channeling, but with a bit more control and
testing, I narrowed it down.

I made it into a cappucino, and I think my milk frothing is getting
better. Recognizing the difference between the "sweet spot" that makes
the "ch-ch-ch" frothing sound and a spot that makes larger air bubbles
is really the key. I could probably get away with frothing less milk
for longer however.

While I believe I am making a cappucino based on relative volume of
microfoam to steamed milk, I need to investigate this. Also, latte art
to impress the ladies.

Easily best espresso drink I've made yet. It's awesome (although not
really a surprise) what quality beans do to your drink!
