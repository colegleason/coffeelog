I made a very small latte in a large cup. Just experimenting a bit
more with the process of steaming/pouring milk for cappucino
vs. latte. I need some work on the distiction between the two, since I
currently think they are coming out a bit too similar.

Also need to make the grind a bit coarser. Just a little bit.
