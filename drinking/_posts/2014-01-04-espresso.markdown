Well, I'm out of that fancy bag of Thirty-Thirty I liked. Time to
crack open the fanciest stuff they have on the shelves at Target! This
was actually the same coffee I used to callibrate my Mazzer Mini, so I
knew what grind setting to put it at.

You know what's upsetting though? I feel like I can pull a better shot
(by sight, not taste) than I can with the good coffee. This shot was
just immediately perfect, while my experience with Thirty-Thirty took
forever.

Dunno.
