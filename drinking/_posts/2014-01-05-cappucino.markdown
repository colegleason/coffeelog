Alright, I give in. I admit it. I think I like this darker, cheaper
espresso better than the fancy Thirty-Thirty stuff. I can just pull
better shots with it for some reason.

Look at that microfoam! Am I fancy or what? This milk is so
deliciously sweet. I think it's because I let it get up to 160F. Note:
try out other temp ranges and do some research on it. I think there
was a few books on steaming milk.

My art is pour, but whatever. That's not terribly important, just cool.
