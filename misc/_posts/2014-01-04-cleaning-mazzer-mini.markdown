title: Cleaning my Mazzer Mini grinder with rice
layout: post
---

I decided I wanted to clean my Mazzer Mini for the first time since
buying it. I purchased it used, and I wasn't sure how often the
previous owner had cleaned it, if at all.

I threw some uncooked rice into the hopper and set it grinding. Rice
was, of course, no match for the Mini's burrs. I soon had a very fine
rice powder in the doser.

After running rice through it a few more times, I dosed out all of the
rice powder, picked up my espresso machine cleaning brush, and set to
work trying to get rid of any rice residue. That was harder than it
looked.

Once I had most of the powder out, I proceeded to run some cheap
espresso beans through the grinder in order to see how it turned
out. There was still rice among the grounds, but after a few more
rounds of beans it was mostly gone.

I don't know what would happen if you pulled a shot with a lot of rice powder residue left in the
basket, but I can't imagine it's a good thing, so do try to avoid it.
